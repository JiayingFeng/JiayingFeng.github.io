  Coding standard to a developer is like grammar to a writer and it is critical attribute of software development from many different aspects. 
  First, it is important because it organize your code in a clear format. By using coding standard, we will write our code based on a pattern instead of messy. And it is easier for other developers to understand our codes too.So the maintenance will be easy because anyone could maintain the code or edit the code since it is well formatted.
  Second, follow the code standard improves the correctness of program because many errors occur due to the reason of the poor coding standard. Based on my experience, many of my errors is because of missing curly-braces. If I follow the coding standard, then it is easy for me to find my errors.
  In the past week, we worked on programming by using IntelliJ. It is a very useful programming tool because it helps us to follow the coding standard and show whether we have errors in the format. If there is errors in the coding standard, then the IntelliJ will show a red cross mark and we have to debug it in order to run the programming. If the code is well-formatted, then it will show a green checkmark.
   Overall, I think that the coding standard is a important guidline for the developers to organize their codes and it saves time for us by increasing the correctness of the codes and it also help programmers to maintain others' codes. It is not only a procedure in programming, but we could use it as a tool to increase the efficiency and reduce the errors.
