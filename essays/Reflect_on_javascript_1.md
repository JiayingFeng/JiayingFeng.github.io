  As a newbie to Javascript, it is an interesting and brand new experience for me to learn this class. I never have any experience on writing javascript. But based on the first week learning of javascript, I think that it is similar to java that we learned in ICS 211. But there are also some differences between java and javascript. 
  
  
  I think the most important difference is that javascript is a language that usually used to write a website and java is the language that almost can use in all the cases. I think javascript isa language that based on Java because they have many similarities such as the loops. 
  
  
   In the past two weeks, I practiced javascript by WODS. I think it is really helpful for me to understand the language and also practice it. WODS is an activity that helps us to develop the ability of thinking and also to build the problem solving skill. I think it is a good way for us to learn Javascript.
