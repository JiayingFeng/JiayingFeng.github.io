Design patterns to software engineers is like the fairy tales to children, children learn about good and devil from the fairy tales, and software engineers learn about good designs and bad designs from design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solution to the commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished code but instead, it is a template for any software engineers to solve problems in different situations.
