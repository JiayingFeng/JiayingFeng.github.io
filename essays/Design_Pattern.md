   Through this semester's study of software engineering development, I am more familiar with the development of application and website. I started to work on my own application with my group members. And through the process of develop my website, I find out that design pattern is really useful for me to solve my issues and improve my ability to become a better developer. 



   Design patterns to software engineers is like the fairy tales to children, children learn about good and devil from the fairy tales, and software engineers learn about good designs and bad designs from design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solution to the commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished code but instead, it is a template for any software engineers to solve problems in different situations.



   I used the prototype design pattern in my own code. Prototype design pattern allows us to create object with the existing object itself. It is used when the creation of object directly is costly, therefore, we could implement a prototype interface and create a clone of the current object.
