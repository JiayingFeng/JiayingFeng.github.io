This is my second year in college as a computer science major students. Last year, I learned the java basics and how to code. This year is different for me because we are learning a new language called javascript and we also need to create our online professional presence. I am looking forward to learn from this class and understand the concepts of software engineering.
This class is a brand new experience for me to learn the computer language and to develop the skills of being a software engineer. I am interested in learning the javascript from this class and I hope that I could be efficient in writing functions.  
I hope that this class could help me to develop the skill of writing functions and javascripts. And I am looking forward for the class activities in this class. I will put hundred percent efforts on this class in order to gain a good grade and to understand all the concepts and skills of being a software engineer.
