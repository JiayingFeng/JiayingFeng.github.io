This is the first game that I developed with my group members for the ICS 111. Before take this class, I never have any experience in computer science field. It was a challenge for me to write code and to learn about java. This game is about control two characters to collect candies and the character that collect most candies is the winner. 

The project is simple but it did take me a lot time and efforts to finish. It is a landmark for me in the computer science field. I was encouraged by this game because it means that I can overcome the difficulty. And since this project, I begin to have confidence towards this major.
